Please follow the instructions carefully or you might have an issue.

First download the files and then open config.json. You will see something like this -

Now put your server's ip and port with the name of the bot of your choice. (PLS NOTE THE SERVER HAS TO BE VERSION 1.16.5 WITH "online-mode=false" OR THE BOT WON'T BE ABLE TO JOIN)

^Basically it means you need cracked server option ON

After that go onto your repositories (github) and make a new repository uploading ALL the files along the edited config.json.

Upload it and head on to https://heroku.com

Login or sign up and click on new > create new app > name it > click connect to github > then search your repository > click connect > scroll down > click branch (main) > click resources and reload

Now turn on your server then go back and click on the pencil button and turn both worked and web on like this and confirm-

Well now you are done the bot will keep your server online 34/7 , it is useful especially if you are using aternos which times out after 5 minutes

The end process should look like this -
